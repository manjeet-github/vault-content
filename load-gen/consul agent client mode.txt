# start consul client agent
# https://github.com/smartdevicelink/manticore/wiki/Start-the-client-agents
# orig CLI: sudo consul agent -data-dir="/tmp/consul" -bind=<ip> -client=<ip> >> /var/log/consul/output.log &
#
# CLI notes
# consul agent starts the agent in client mode. Remember that adding -server starts the agent in server mode
# -data-dir is here for the same reason we need it for the consul server agent
# -bind=<ip> also will attach the agent to the ip specified. This is required if there are multiple IPs found. 
# Use the IP of the host machine this agent is on.
# -client=<ip> is the key in making our Manticore system work. It functions the same way as -bind, 
# only now ALL interactions with the agent must now be made on the IP address specified instead of local host (127.0.0.1). Use the same IP as in the -bind flag.
# /var/log/consul/output.log is a recommended location to print the log stream. Make sure the directory exists first
# & Run the agent in the background
#
# setup log dir
